#### Instructions

##### Step 1
Cook the aubergines and tomatoes over a fire. This could be on a barbecue or on a gas stove top. If you don't have these you can grill or roast them, but an open flame will give the smokey flavour. The tomatoes just need a little charring but the aubergines need to be cooked right through. Turn them regularly and then put onto a plate as each one becomes ready.
##### Step 2
Peel the garlic cloves and put on a skewer or cocktail stick. Lightly cook these on the flame.
##### Step 3
Once cooled a little, peel the tomatoes and aubergines with a spoon. Keep the fleshy part and discard the burnt skins and any stalks.
##### Step 4
Crush the garlic and chop finely. Heat oil in a pan and cook the garlic on a low medium heat - sizzling slightly. Once lightly browned, add tomato puree and leave to cook for 5 mins.
##### Step 5
Roughly chop the tomatoes and add to the pan. Add the spices. While cooking, chop the aubergines into large chunks.
##### Step 6
After at least another 5 mins, add the aubergines to the pan. Stir and cook for 5 mins. If your aubergines were thoroughly cooked on the flame earlier, they will not need long in the pan.
##### Step 7
Serve as a dip with bread and salad. You can garnish with ingredients such as basil, spring onion or parsley.
