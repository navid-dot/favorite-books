## Ingredients


⅓ cup skim milk 

1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin

2 ½ cups heavy cream

½ cup white sugar

1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract

## Directions

Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.

Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.

Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.

Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.

When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.
